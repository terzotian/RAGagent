Early Alert System To enhance support for a student with potential study problems, the Programme Curriculum Committee (PCC) of the programme will give an early warning/advice to the student or may 10 have a special consideration for the student's chance of study continuation, which depends on the conditions specified below. • If a student's Cumulative G. P. A. is equal to or greater than 2. 50 but smaller than 2. 67, then the PCC of the MSc DS Programme will give an early warning/advice to the student. • If a student's Cumulative G. P. A. is smaller than 2. 50 but equal to or greater than 2. 33 (equivalent to "C+"), then the PCC of the MSc DS Programme may have a special consideration for the student's chance of study continuation.

--- Segment 39 ---
33 (equivalent to "C+"), then the PCC of the MSc DS Programme may have a special consideration for the student's chance of study continuation. Here, the cumulative G. P. A. of 2. 33 is regarded as the minimum Cumulative G. P. A. threshold for special consideration for a chance of continuation. • If the student satisfies the Cumulative G. P. A. requirement for special consideration, then the student can apply for an interview to be conducted by the Programme Director , who will closely consider the student's eligibility for continuation and then report their recommendation to the Board of Examiners for the MSc DS Programme. The Board of Examiners will make a decision on the marginal case and report their thinking and decision to the University's Postgraduate Studies Committee (PSC) for information, or make recommendations on the marginal case for special consideration by the PSC for a chance of continuation. If approved by the PSC, the student who is given a chance of continuation will be put on academic probation in the following term, the academic probation will be lifted if he/she obtains a cumulative GPA of 2.
