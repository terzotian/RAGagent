Young non-local students are often unfamiliar with housing and rental conditions in Hong Kong, so they may encounter problems during the rental process. The Real Estate Agents Regulatory Authority (EAA) was established in November 1997 under the Real Estate Agent Ordinance, which is responsible for regulating the practice of Hong Kong real estate agents.

The Real Estate Agents Regulatory Authority (EAA) was established in November 1997 under the Real Estate Agent Ordinance, which is responsible for regulating the practice of Hong Kong real estate agents. The Regulatory Bureau publishes a booklet for non-local students, introducing things to note when renting a house in Hong Kong. **Statement**: The information in this booklet is for general reference only and does not constitute legal advice. If you have any questions about individual circumstances, you should seek legal advice. The Authority shall not be responsible for any losses arising from the use of all or part of the contents of this booklet. --- ## Background - Hong Kong has a small land and a large population, and the government provides public rental housing and funding housing sales plans (if the residents have their own housing plans). These houses cannot be rented freely on the second-hand market until the transfer restrictions are lifted. Therefore, most of the properties available for rent on the market come from private residences. - In addition to residential properties, there are also industrial or commercial properties in Hong Kong. Some owners will rent out the property in separate rooms, with a small area and a low rent, but may involve illegal construction and safety issues. - Property transactions can be completed directly by the buyer and seller, and they will usually entrust real estate agents to assist in the placement, leasing or transaction.

- Property transactions can be completed directly by the buyer and seller, and they will usually entrust real estate agents to assist in the placement, leasing or transaction. - The rights and interests of owners and tenants are protected by the "Owners and Tenants (Comprehensive) Regulations", and the practice of real estate agents is regulated by the Real Estate Agency Supervision Bureau. --- ## Entrusted Licensed Real Estate Agent - Although tenants can trade with the owner on their own (such as through an online platform), this move involves safety and legal risks. - Licensed real estate agents are regulated by the Regulatory Bureau, with professional knowledge of property leasing and higher protection. - Each licensed agent holds a license, and the public can check whether the agent holds a valid license through the website of the Regulatory Bureau.

If the house is sponsored for sale, if the resident has a unit, the restrictions cannot be rented. - The transfer restrictions can be confirmed through land checking. ### Sublease - Sublease is complicated and it is necessary to confirm that the property is rented out by the owner or sublease by the second landlord.
